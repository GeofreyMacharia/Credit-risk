# Credit-risk
This a risk analysis project focusing on analyzing credit  customer data to uncover patterns and risk factors that affect loan repayment.

## Case Study
With the ever expanding market, alot of people are opening businesses left and right and as with all businesses, hving capital is necessary.
However, not everyone goes to banks for business related loans, some have purchases they'd like to make or payments for various reasons. 
As such banks are ready and willing to hand out loans (money on credit) with respective repayment plans.
However, in order for banks not to face finacial issues themselves, they cannot hand out loans to everyone. 
Only to those whodo not run the risk of being defaulters.
